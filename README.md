# ETQImportSpreadsheetChecker
This application was developed in conjunction with multiple deployments of the ETQ Reliance Quality Management Software (QMS).  The ETQ Reliance application supports “import spreadsheets” where administrators can perform bulk data-imports from a MS Excel file. The import spreadsheets can greatly reduce the Reliance module implementation time but are dependent on the accuracy of the values in the file.  For example, if importing values into a field that is bound against a keyword list, the values in the import spreadsheet need to exactly match the allowable values in the list.  When attempting an import into Reliance, if any data-issues are detected, the admin is alerted to the first, and only the first, error in the file that needs to be resolved.

This is not a big deal if there are only a handful of errors in the file, but can make the import process very time consuming and frustrating if the admin needs to continuously go back-and-forth between correcting the spreadsheet and attempting the import time and time again.

This Import Spreadsheet Checker application performs a full validation of the import spreadsheet, comparing against the Reliance system (SQL database tables). The program will highlight and report all data-issues detected in the file and provide a fast interface to update and re-validate the values prior to attempting the actual import into Reliance.
